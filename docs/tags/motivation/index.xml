      <description>Every founder of every new public initiative or project at some point needs to answer this one question. Question about conquering the world.
People ask me “How does Learney want to compete with Twitter, Medium, HackerNews or Facebook groups where we already look for knowledge?” That’s a really good question, but my answer may surprise you a bit.
Why? Because I don’t want to compete with them. That’s not even my long-term goal.</description>
