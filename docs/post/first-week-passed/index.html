<h2 id="such-a-week">Such a week!</h2>

<p>Only ten days passed since Learney has launched and tons of amazing things already happened. Let me share this short update with you to summarize everything and explain what’s on the roadmap for incoming weeks.</p>

<p>First and foremost - a few words about all that feedback you’ve been sending to me through that period. I’m really amazed how many people want to support this random project of a random guy who believes that knowledge sharing worths much more attention, especially in the context of software development. I’ve been talking with Learney users multiple times on LinkedIn, Messenger and through email where you shared your thoughts about the features you love, and also those that require more work. Some of the suggestions have already been implemented, other are waiting in a queue, but your voice really matters. I hope there will be more of this, because it’s a platform powered by us - the Learney community.</p>

<p>During the launch period I posted a few messages here and there to let you know about my project. The most meaningful source of attracting new users was of course my post on ProductHunt - <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/learney">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/learney</a>. It’s really amazing to see more than 120 people upvoting this app, commenting and investing time to help me improve it. I’m listening to you - I promise.</p>

<p>For those of you who tweet with me - there’s a new Twitter profile of Learney (<a href="https://twitter.com/learneyapp">@learneyapp</a>) so I’d like to invite you to follow it to learn about all those updates and newly released features before everyone else.</p>

<p>Speaking about features… there are three really meaningful improvements introduced recently and now I’d like to talk more about them:</p>

<h2 id="bookmarks-read-it-later">Bookmarks - read it later</h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:71.301%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/8dt21/blhcte" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

<p>Saving stories for later was one of the most popular suggestions I was reading about in the feedback you gave me. As promised - listening to your voice resulted in newly released Bookmarks feature. Thanks to Bookmarks you can collect the most interesting stories in one place and read them later. No need to manage your subscriptions, no need to change browser accounts or looking for a proper device. The most important content you find thanks to Learney now in one place - in your Learney profile.</p>

<h2 id="automation-save-your-time">Automation - save your time</h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:72.222%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/gbikj/hywtpt" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

<p>One of my biggest goals for Learney is to create such a learning experience where people could avoid struggling with software and instead they can focus on growing and shaping their skills. Every single step that is unnecessary will be removed the app, starting from today. Today, users who are adding new content to Learney don’t need to manually type the title and description of every single story, because Learney fills the details for you. Saved time, delivered.</p>

<h2 id="story-management">Story management</h2>

<p>Story management is such a broad topic that features from this scope will be shipped incrementally. With today’s release Learney users can start cleaning up the content they add by deleting stories. It can help in both story administration and quick delete and re-add scenario when you introduced a typo or named given resource in a wrong way. No big deal, but finally there.</p>

<h2 id="and-it-s-just-a-first-week">&hellip;and it&rsquo;s just a first week</h2>

<p>Learney&rsquo;s roadmap is full of solutions that are focused on finding the knowledge matching your skills and experience. By engaging more and more people we can build a community that will turn this into reality. It’s just a first week, but damn… such a week it was!</p>
