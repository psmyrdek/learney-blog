        <p>My name is Przemek, I’m a 25-year-old software engineer from Cracow, Poland. Since last few years, I’ve been focused on different aspects of knowledge sharing within our industry. One of my ongoing goals is to give back to the community through all kinds of activities like running a blog for aspiring developers, preparing conference talks, writing articles or contributing to open source.</p>

<p>By doing all of this not only I’m able to express my “thanks for everything” for other software developers but also learn about your day-to-day struggles related to gathering the knowledge, avoiding distractions and just becoming more competent. This never-ending learning journey is something that affects all of us - interns, junior developers, but also people who can be easily called experts. Why? Because to be able to learn and grow we constantly need to look for valuable resources that work as leverage for us. We need posts, articles, courses, and videos that not only come from the industry we work in, not only cover the topics of the same technologies we’re using to build our projects but also match or exceed our experience and seniority level.</p>

<p>Gathering valuable knowledge in such dynamic environment like ours can be achieved through various ways, but one of the most popular is probably through knowledge aggregators. We use Twitter to follow experts which helps us learn new things. We use Reddit to subscribe to the newest and the most exciting content from a given branch of software development. Sometimes we even use YouTube to watch others teaching us the craft. All of that works fine but at the same time you can’t say it was built keeping developers in mind. As a result, we’re facing tons of unrelated posts, news and “must sees” which distract us from gathering the knowledge. Besides software development, there are suggestions that help us procrastinate instead of focus on a given subject. I strongly believe we can do better.</p>

<p>Today I’d like to show you Learney (<a href="https://learney.io">https://learney.io</a>) - my take on the topic of knowledge aggregators focused especially on the needs of software developers.</p>

<p>There are at least two aspects of Learney you may find useful - the first one is related to people eager to learn new things, and the second one is related to creators and teachers. Let me briefly describe both perspectives.</p>

<p>The first perspective is related to the needs of developers who want to grow and constantly expand their skillset. In Learney, people like you and me can easily pick the paths they want to follow to get the most valuable knowledge, but what’s even more important - we can finally avoid all that irrelevant noise. By noise, I mean topics which are either too advanced or too basic topics at a given point in our career. Each resource you post (a blog post, an article, a video) contains corresponding seniority level that can be also suggested by others. In Learney senior developers can filter out “how to hello world” stories, while junior developers can gradually pick more and more advanced topics.</p>

<p>Additionally, thanks to Discovery page, you’re able to widen your worldview and discover all the things outside of your areas of interest. This feature is still pretty young, but in the future I’d like to introduce even more exciting features that will work as an automatic learning assistant showing you relevant opportunities to develop your skills, suggesting new topics and making sure that you’re moving forward.</p>

<p>The second perspective I’d like to talk about is the perspective of content creators.</p>

<p>What’s in front of this project?</p>

<p>Today it’s too early to promise that Learney will radically change how you approach learning and gathering the knowledge. All I can tell you right now is that I’m trying to understand the needs of developers looking for growth opportunities and I want to learn all of that from you.</p>
