        <p>Every founder of every new public initiative or project at some point needs to answer this one question. Question about conquering the world.</p>

<p>People ask me “How does Learney want to compete with Twitter, Medium, HackerNews or Facebook groups where we already look for knowledge?” That’s a really good question, but my answer may surprise you a bit.</p>

<p>Why? Because I don’t want to compete with them. That’s not even my long-term goal.</p>

<p>There are thousands of reasons for that, but the most important one could be expressed as “mind the scale”. Think about the size of those companies compared to my small project. For example, Twitter is being visited by about 400 mln users… each month. Per quarter, their revenue is equal to about 700 mln dollars. And there’s Facebook, which - when counting all of their products - is being used by more than 2 bln people. Those companies shouldn’t be treated as friendly social media websites with a nice logo and responsive design. No, these guys run a huge business.</p>

<p>Learney is not like them. It has about 20 days of running live and about 600 registered members in its community. It is being created and developed by just one person who is responsible for product management, software development, design, communication with users, responding to feedback and making social media buzz. It would be stupid for me to focus on competing with those factories of products.</p>

<p>So why do I care about it? Why do I spend my time working on it? Why do I encourage you to go and test it?</p>

<p>It’s because of the issue that is related to gathering valuable knowledge by software developers, which - in my opinion - hasn’t been solved yet. For the last few years, I’ve been really involved in a community of software developers. Through blogs, conference talks, meetups and live discussions I had a chance to listen to your stories related to making first steps in our industry. Believe, for most of the time I haven’t been told stories like “yeah, Facebook really helps me gather the knowledge”, or “yeah, Twitter makes me more effective”, or maybe “true, it’s easy for me to find the knowledge adjusted to my needs”. No, for most of the time it was more like “I have no idea where to find useful knowledge”, or “I have no idea which resources help me become a better specialist” or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do next in my career&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You’re right - the amount of knowledge which is waiting for you on the internet is really enormous. The problem is, the more links there are, the more time you need to spend on filtering everything. The bigger the overhead is. The paradox of choice hits you.</p>

<p>That’s why I decided to build something new. By creating Learney I’m trying to start a movement which is about connecting software developers to the most valuable knowledge. Knowledge, which is adjusted to your needs, interests, and experience.</p>

<p>I want to serve those who think about becoming better. Who think and care about their own development (this personal one). I want to help people who’re seeking the resources, but they need to deal with complex aggregators, flaky user interfaces, mixed content related to both React and politics, algorithms smarter than themselves, and many other issues.</p>

<p>Learney is not about conquering the world or competing with 15-year-old market leaders, who may not even be the best at this point. Is Facebook really about helping software developers? I don’t think so. Maybe it’s their side-effect but poorly executed. Is Twitter really about helping software developers? Yeah, in some areas it’s useful, but all the time? No. Can both beginners and lead developers find useful resources at HackerNews? Based on my experience, no. Not really.</p>

<p>It seems that there’s still enough space for this small project created by a developer who wants to help other developers.</p>

<p>That’s really it.</p>
